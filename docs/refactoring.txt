Refactoring

1. File: WalkSim.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): main(String[] args), Line 35,48,59,87 and 1577
   Issue Identified: Magic numbers used to represent different walker types.
   Description of fix: Used named constants or an enum to make the code more readable.

2. File: SpiralWalker.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): walk(int Nsteps), Line 47 and 52
   Issue Identified: The logic for adding the current position to the path is repeated in the walk method.
   Description of fix: Moved the path update logic into a separate method to avoid code duplication.

3. File: RandomWalker.java and BreadCrumbWalker.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): RandomWalker.java - getStepDirection() Line 105,107 and 109
			                         BreadCrumbWalker.java - getStepDirection() Line 122,124 and 126
   Issue Identified: The constants "N," "E," "S," "W" are hardcoded in the getStepDirection method.
   Description of fix: Consider using an enum or constants for cardinal directions to enhance readability
                       and avoid magic strings.
