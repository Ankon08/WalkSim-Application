WalkSim is a Java program that simulates different types of walks (random walk, spiral walk, and breadcrumb walk)
based on user input and generates an animation of the walk path. 
The program prompts the user to input the number of steps and the type of walker. 
For random walk and breadcrumb walk, the user is also asked to provide a file containing a FloatMatrix.
The walk paths are then simulated, saved to an output file, and visualized using the WalkFrame class.
